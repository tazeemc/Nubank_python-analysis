# **Nubank Macro Analysis: LatAm’s Fintech Black Swan**
*By [Tazeem Chowdhury](https://redhoodcapital.substack.com/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/tazeemc)*

A **Python + Power BI** pipeline to analyze **Nubank ($NU)** in the context of Brazil’s macroeconomic environment (BRL/USD, Selic Rate, IPCA Inflation). Built for **traders, data analysts, and fintech enthusiasts**, this project automates data fetching, transformation, and visualization to uncover **thermodynamic relationships** between $NU and Brazil’s macro drivers.

## **📊 Project Overview**
This repository provides:
1. **Automated data pipelines** for $NU stock prices and Brazil macro data.
2. **Interactive dashboards** (Plotly/Power BI) to visualize correlations.
3. **Trade signals** based on macro thresholds (e.g., BRL/USD > 5.5 → Long $NU).
4. **Integration with GitHub/Substack** for sharing insights.

**Key Themes**:
- *"LatAm’s fintech boom is borrowed time—until the Fed remembers gravity."*
- **Entropy in markets**: How macro shocks (Selic hikes, BRL volatility) impact $NU.
- **Data-driven storytelling**: For [RedHood Reads](https://redhoodcapital.substack.com/p/redhood-reads-12) comic narratives.
